## Investigation environment:

Hypervisor: Oracle **Virtual Box**

OS used for analysis: **REMnux** (Linux)

## Context:

As an analyst at a Security Operations Center (SOC), you check alerts for the past week
and find a signature hit for ET MALWARE Lumma Stealer Victim Fingerprinting
Activity that triggered on traffic from **153.92.1[.]49** over TCP port 80. The alert
triggered on 2026-01-27 at 23:05 UTC.

Using the information, you retrieve a packet capture (pcap) of the traffic from the internal IP
address that triggered the alert. Based on the pcap, you write up an incident report, so the
incident responders can track down the computer and associated user.

## Steps of the investigation:

1. wget https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2026/01/31/2026-01-31-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap.zip
2. Setting Virtual Network Adapter to *Internal Network* (isolating analysis from the Internet).
3. Identifying the victim from initial DHCP Request (acknowledged).
   
   **MAC Address:** 00:21:5d:c8:0e:f2
   
   **IP Address:** 10.1.21.58
   
   **Host Name:** DESKTOP-ES9F3ML

4. Further identifying his **Username: _gwyatt_** from one of **Kerberos** packets (filtering by _kerberos.CNameString_).

5. Finally I linked the victim's _Username_ with his **Full Name: _Gabriel Wyatt_**, which I found in some local network communication (using global search).

6. Filter the traffic to see the HTTP conversation between _Gabriel_ and malicious server (ip.addr == 153.92.1[.]49 && http)

7. Following the TCP stream of the POST request exposes the malicious domain: **_whitepepper[.]su_**

8. I also discovered immediately appearing fresh (DNS request just before) **suspicious domains** performing TLS Handshake Protocol:

 This may indicate these are **`C2 Redundancy / Domain Rotator`** type domains.
 
 **VirusTotal results:**
